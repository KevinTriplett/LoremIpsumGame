Gentle reminder that "<%= @game.name %>" is
waiting for your amazing imagination.
======================================================

Here's your magic link:
<%= @url %>

<% if @players.count > 0 %>
  Players who've played since your last turn, in order:
  <% @players.each do |name| %>
  - <%= name %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
Round <%= @user.game.round %> of <%= @user.game.num_rounds %>
